## What is Jadey?
Jadey is an _open-source_ Markdown editor for Windows 10. It makes use of the technologies found in the Universal Windows Platform to make it responsive and work across Windows 10 devices. Designed for use with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in mind, Jadey provides easy access to Markdown features like emphasis, image linking, and insertion of Jekyll's own configuration properties at the top of files. It even includes common things in Universal Windows apps, like copy/paste functionality and spell-checking.
